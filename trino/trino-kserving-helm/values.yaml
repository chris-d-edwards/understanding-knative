##Loading Custom image in local cluster and for use it with Kind with knative serving is necessary to have the possibility 
  # to access to ECR because knative make tag digest resolution. To avoid this is necessary to tag use that knative skip by default
  # for example `kind.local,ko.local,dev.local` or add our registry  in config-deployment
  # https://knative.dev/docs/admin/serving/deployment/
